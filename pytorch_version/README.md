# KGCN-pytorch

This is the Pytorch implementation of [KGCN](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3313417) ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12575)):

## Dataset

- ### Movie

    Raw rating file for movie is too large to be contained in this repo.

    Downlad the rating data first
    ```bash
    $ wget http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-20m.zip
    $ unzip ml-20m.zip
    $ mv ml-20m/ratings.csv data/movie/
    ```

- ### Music

    Nothing to do

- ### Other dataset

    If you want to use your own dataset, you need to prepare 2 data.

    1. Rating data
        - Each row should contain (user-item-rating)
        - In this repo, it is pandas dataframe structure. (look at `data_loader.py`)
    2. Knowledge graph
        - Each triple(head-relation-tail) consists of knowledge graph
        - In this repo, it is dictionary type. (look at `data_loader.py`)

## Structure
1.  `data_loader.py`
    - data loader class for movie / music dataset
    - you don't need it if you make custom dataset

2. `aggregator.py`
    - aggregator class which implements 3 aggregation functions

3. `model.py`
    - KGCN model network

## Running the code

Look at the `KGCN.ipynb`.
